****Twitter Sentiment Analysis****
This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using a Logistic Regression model. It classifies tweets into two categories:

**Positive sentiment
Negative sentiment**
The dataset used for this project is the Sentiment140 Dataset, which consists of 1.6 million tweets labeled with their sentiment.

**Project Overview**
Dataset: The Sentiment140 dataset.
Preprocessing:
Removed non-alphabetic characters.
Converted text to lowercase.
Removed stopwords.
Applied stemming using the Porter Stemmer.
Feature Extraction: Used TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.
Model: Logistic Regression.
**Accuracy:**
_Training: 79.87%
Testing: 77.67%_
Features
**Data Preprocessing:
**
Text cleaning (removing punctuation, special characters, etc.).
Stopword removal.
Stemming of words for reducing redundancy.
Feature Extraction:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer to represent text data numerically.
Model Training and Testing:

Logistic Regression is used for classification.
Model evaluated on training and testing datasets with accuracy scores.

**Train the Model:
**Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Train a Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF features.
Evaluate the Model:
Evaluate the model's accuracy on the testing set.
Predict Sentiment:
Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of a tweet:


**Results**
Training Accuracy: 79.87%
Testing Accuracy: 77.67%
**Future Work**
Use deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, BERT) to improve accuracy.
Add visualization for data analysis and model performance.
Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI.
